Language: C

Objective: The goal for this project was to implement a shell in C, such that when you type in a command, the shell creates a child process that executes the command entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.

I had so much fun with this project. It dealt with precisely what fascinates me most in computer science, namely shells. The program should work as expected and has no dependencies.
